# AWS Lambda Function: EC2 Start/Stop Controller

This AWS Lambda function allows you to start or stop an EC2 instance using a scheduled event or manual trigger. It can be useful for cost optimization by turning off development instances during non-working hours.

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… Start and stop EC2 instances
- âœ… Works with scheduled CloudWatch Events
- âœ… Written in Python (can be modified for other runtimes)
- âœ… Uses IAM Role permissions securely.

## Lambdas use cases:

- Thumbnails: Receive an image into S3 (this will trigger a lambda) and the lambda will create a small version of the image to store again into S3 and will store the metadata of the image into dynamoDB.
- CRON Jobs: Schedule to run a script (with Cloud Watch Event Bridge).
